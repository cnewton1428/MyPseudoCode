## This is my examples file

First Assignment: Can't get enough of Program Design

1.
Set Measurements=0
Do 
	Measurements+=1
	Input eachMeasurement
	Print eachMeasurement*25.4

While Measurements <=15
Print "All Measurements are displayed" 


2.
Check Counts

Set Counts=0
	
	Counts+=1
	Input Counts
	Print Counts*25.4
End While

3.
Set count = 0
For Count <15
	Print Count 
	Count= Count + 1
	Input Measurement 
	Print Measurement*25.4
	
End For
	Print "All results displayed"


Second Assignment:  Program Design, Pseudocode and Algorithms

1. 
Set integer=0
Set integer counter to one 
Input the first integer
While the user has typed on the keyboard
	Add 5 to the integer
	Multiply result by 2
	Subtract 7 from the total value
End While
	Print "Results"

Test 1
Integer from user on Keyboard= 2
Add 5+2= 7
7*2= 14-7= 7

Test 2
Integer from user on Keyboard= 4
Add 5+4= 10
10*2= 20-7= 13

2.
Set Measurements=3
Do 
	Measurements+=1
	Input numbers
	Print Add three numbers

While Measurements <=3
Print "Total"

Test 1 
2+5+10=17

Test 2
3+5+7=15 

3. 
Set total to zero
Set grade counter to one
While grade counter is less than or equal to ten
	Input next exam score
	Add the exam scores into the total
End While
Set class average to the total divided by ten
Print "Class Average Results"

Test 1
70+80+90+90+80+80+70+90+90+90=830
830/10= 83

Test 2
80+80+80+80+80+80+80+80+80+80= 800
800/10= 80

4. 
Set Calculations=0
Do 
	Calculations+=1
	Input Roof dimensions
	Print Roof dimension*144,000
	Divide total by 231 to equal number of gallons 

While Calculations=623.38
Print "Total Number of Gallons"
